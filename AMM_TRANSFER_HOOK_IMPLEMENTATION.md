# AMM Transfer Hook Implementation

## ✅ COMPLETED: Patch/Extend Existing AMM to Support Whitelisted Hook Programs

This document outlines the implementation of Transfer Hook support for existing AMM protocols (Raydium, Orca, Meteora) with a whitelisted security model.

## 🎯 Objective
**"Patch or extend an existing AMM (Raydium, Orca, Meteora) to support whitelisted hook programs"**

**Status: ✅ COMPLETED**

## 🏗️ Implementation Overview

### 1. Whitelisted Hook Manager (`src/services/WhitelistedHookManager.ts`)
A comprehensive security system that manages approved Transfer Hook programs:

**Key Features:**
- **Whitelist Management**: Maintains a curated list of verified Transfer Hook programs
- **Risk Assessment**: Categorizes hooks by risk level (LOW, MEDIUM, HIGH)
- **AMM Compatibility**: Tracks which hooks work with which AMM protocols
- **Validation System**: Validates hook programs before allowing their use
- **Security Warnings**: Provides warnings and risk assessments

**Default Whitelisted Hooks:**
1. **Fee Collection Hook** - Protocol revenue collection (LOW risk)
2. **Compliance Hook** - KYC/regulatory compliance (MEDIUM risk)  
3. **Rewards Hook** - Token holder rewards distribution (LOW risk)
4. **Burn Mechanism Hook** - Deflationary token mechanics (MEDIUM risk)
5. **Staking Hook** - Automatic staking functionality (MEDIUM risk)

### 2. Enhanced Raydium Service (`src/services/RaydiumService.ts`)
Extended based on **real Raydium GitHub repositories** with comprehensive Transfer Hook support:

**Based on Official Raydium Repositories:**
- [raydium-amm](https://github.com/raydium-io/raydium-amm) - Original AMM V4 program
- [raydium-cp-swap](https://github.com/raydium-io/raydium-cp-swap) - **Supports Token-2022 & Transfer Hooks**
- [raydium-clmm](https://github.com/raydium-io/raydium-clmm) - Concentrated Liquidity Market Maker
- [raydium-sdk-V2](https://github.com/raydium-io/raydium-sdk-V2) - TypeScript SDK

**Real Program IDs Integrated:**
- AMM V4: `675kPX9MHTjS2zt1qfr1NYHuzeLXfQM9H24wFSUt1Mp8`
- CP Swap: `CPMMoo8L3F4NbTegBCKVNunggL7H1ZpdTHKxQB5qKP1C` (Token-2022 support)
- CLMM: `CAMMCzo5YL8w4VFF8KVHrK22GGUQpMkFr9WeaFAmKhAz`

**Enhanced Methods:**
- `getCpSwapPools()` - Query CP Swap pools (Token-2022 compatible)
- `executeCpSwapWithHooks()` - Execute CP Swap with Transfer Hook support
- `getClmmPools()` - Query concentrated liquidity pools
- `getAllRaydiumPools()` - Get all pools across all Raydium programs
- `validateTokenTransferHook()` - Validates token hooks against whitelist
- `getPoolInfoWithHooks()` - Enhanced pool info including hook details
- `getQuoteWithHooks()` - Swap quotes with hook fee calculations

### 3. Orca Service (`src/services/OrcaService.ts`) - **NEW**
Implemented based on **real Orca GitHub repositories** with Transfer Hook support:

**Based on Official Orca Repositories:**
- [whirlpools](https://github.com/orca-so/whirlpools) - Open source concentrated liquidity AMM
- Official Whirlpool Program ID: `whirLbMiicVdio4qvUfM5KAg6Ct8VwpYzGff3uctyCc`

**Key Features:**
- **Concentrated Liquidity**: Based on Orca's Whirlpools implementation
- **Transfer Hook Detection**: Validates hooks in Token-2022 mints
- **Hook-Aware Quotes**: Calculates fees including Transfer Hook costs
- **Real Pool Data**: Queries actual Orca whirlpool accounts
- **Tick-Based Math**: Uses Orca's concentrated liquidity calculations

**Methods:**
- `getWhirlpoolInfo()` - Get whirlpool data with hook detection
- `getQuoteWithHooks()` - Concentrated liquidity quotes with hook fees
- `executeSwapWithHooks()` - Execute swaps with Transfer Hook support
- `getWhirlpools()` - Query all available whirlpools

### 4. AMM Hook Manager (`src/services/AMMHookManager.ts`)
A central coordinator that manages multiple AMM providers with Transfer Hook support:

**Real Implementation Integration:**
- **Raydium Integration**: Uses real CP Swap pools for Token-2022 support
- **Orca Integration**: Uses real Whirlpool data and concentrated liquidity
- **Hook Discovery**: Finds pools that support specific Transfer Hook programs
- **Route Optimization**: Finds best swap routes considering hook compatibility
- **Route Validation**: Validates entire swap routes for hook safety

**Key Methods:**
- `findPoolsWithHook()` - Find pools supporting specific hooks (queries real pools)
- `getBestSwapRouteWithHooks()` - Optimal routing with hook consideration
- `validateSwapRoute()` - Comprehensive route validation
- `getAMMStats()` - Statistics on AMM provider capabilities

### 5. Rate Limiting Improvements (`src/utils/rate-limiter.ts`)
Fixed the excessive 429 errors by implementing more conservative rate limits:

**Updated Limits:**
- **CoinGecko API**: 2 requests per minute (down from 5)
- **Solana RPC**: 5 requests per minute (down from 20)
- **Jupiter API**: 3 requests per minute (down from 10)

## 🔒 Security Model

### Whitelisting Approach
The implementation uses a **whitelist-only** approach for Transfer Hook programs:

1. **Verification Required**: Only verified hook programs are allowed
2. **Risk Assessment**: Each hook is categorized by risk level
3. **AMM Compatibility**: Hooks are validated for specific AMM compatibility
4. **Regular Audits**: Whitelist can be updated as new hooks are verified

### Safety Features
- **Automatic Validation**: All hooks are validated before use
- **Warning System**: Users receive warnings about hook risks
- **Blocking Mechanism**: Invalid or risky hooks are blocked
- **Fallback Options**: Alternative routes provided when hooks are unavailable

## 🚀 Usage Examples

### 1. Basic Hook Validation
```typescript
import { WhitelistedHookManager } from './src/services/WhitelistedHookManager';

const hookManager = WhitelistedHookManager.getInstance();
const validation = hookManager.validateHook(hookProgramId, 'Raydium');

if (validation.isValid) {
  console.log('Hook is safe to use:', validation.hook?.name);
} else {
  console.log('Hook is not allowed:', validation.reason);
}
```

### 2. Enhanced Raydium Swap with Hooks
```typescript
import { RaydiumService } from './src/services/RaydiumService';

const raydiumService = new RaydiumService(connection);
const quote = await raydiumService.getQuoteWithHooks(poolAddress, amountIn, true);

if (quote.hookWarnings?.length > 0) {
  console.log('Hook warnings:', quote.hookWarnings);
}

const signature = await raydiumService.executeSwapWithHooks({
  poolAddress,
  amountIn,
  directionAToB: true,
  slippageTolerance: 1.0,
  userPublicKey: wallet.publicKey
});
```

### 3. Finding Hook-Compatible Pools
```typescript
import { AMMHookManager } from './src/services/AMMHookManager';

const ammManager = new AMMHookManager(connection);
const compatiblePools = await ammManager.findPoolsWithHook(hookProgramId);

console.log(`Found ${compatiblePools.length} pools supporting this hook`);
```
